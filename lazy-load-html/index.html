        Recent studies show that voice assistants have become increasingly
        popular with 27% of the global online population using them on a monthly
        basis, and this number is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years.
        However, the accuracy and naturalness of speech recognition and voice
        synthesis systems remain a significant challenge for widespread
        adoption. According to a report by the Stanford Open Voice Network, 44%
        of users experience issues with speech recognition accuracy, and 48% of
        users feel that voice assistants sound too robotic. Improving the
        accuracy and naturalness of these systems would significantly improve
        user experience and facilitate the widespread adoption of voice
        technology. In addition, voice technology has shown great potential for
        improving accessibility in various domains, such as healthcare and
        education, where hands-free interaction is crucial. By exploring
        approaches to enhance the capabilities of voice technology through
        machine learning, I hope to contribute to the advancement of this field
        and create more inclusive and accessible solutions for users.

        My research interests are firmly rooted in exploring the latest
        scientific approaches and technological innovations that can enhance the
        accuracy and naturalness of speech recognition and voice synthesis
        systems. According to a recent study, the global speech and voice
        recognition market size was valued at USD 10.6 billion in 2020 and is
        projected to reach USD 27.16 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 12.2%
        from 2021 to 2028. Enabling natural language interaction with machines
        and devices is gaining widespread adoption in various sectors such as
        healthcare, education, and entertainment. A recent report by Grand View
        Research estimates that the healthcare sector alone is expected to have
        a CAGR of 20.5% over the forecast period from 2021 to 2028, with voice
        recognition technology playing a key role in improving patient outcomes
        and reducing healthcare costs. With these statistics in mind, my
        investigations may involve developing advanced machine learning models
        that can understand and interpret spoken commands and execute tasks with
        increased accuracy and efficiency. Through my research, I aim to help
        advance the capabilities of voice technology, unlocking its potential to
        revolutionize human-machine interaction across a wide range of domains.
