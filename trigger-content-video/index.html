              Recent studies show that voice assistants have become increasingly
              popular with 27% of the global online population using them on a
              monthly basis, and this number is expected to grow rapidly in the
              coming years.

              However, the accuracy and naturalness of speech recognition and
              voice synthesis systems remain a significant challenge for
              widespread adoption. According to a report by the Stanford Open
              Voice Network, 44% of users experience issues with speech
              recognition accuracy, and 48% of users feel that voice assistants
              sound too robotic.

              Improving the accuracy and naturalness of these systems would
              significantly improve user experience and facilitate the
              widespread adoption of voice technology. In addition, voice
              technology has shown great potential for improving accessibility
              in various domains, such as healthcare and education, where
              hands-free interaction is crucial. By exploring approaches to
              enhance the capabilities of voice technology through machine
              learning, I hope to contribute to the advancement of this field
              and create more inclusive and accessible solutions for users.
